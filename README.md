### Parts of a computer
-software (logical code)

-hardware (physical objects we can hold)

-firmware (software for the hardware) 
### hardware
-ram "random access memory" (volatile memory) meaning data that is gone once server loses power or restarts

-rom "read only memory" (non volatile) data remains stored after loss of power 

-cpu "central processing unit" executes tasks, works as the brain of a server

-disk storage -graphics card -monitor -cd rom -usb -floppy disk

### Operating system 
a platform that contains libraries and an infrustructure for applications to be used.
the function of an operating system is to make the computer more convenient to use and make it more efficient for the systems resources to be used. Also enabling the ability to evolve through development and testing

namespaces in the OS
-kernel space
-user space

application uses libraries to communicate with the kernel (system calls) & kernel uses deviuce drivers to communicate with hardware

kernal is a core component to the OS 
4 main functions is 
1&2. allows communications from app to hardware and vice versa 
3 manages memory 
4 process management
