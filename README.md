## Lesson 1: Introduction to Computers and Operating Systems

### üì¶ Parts of a Computer

- **Software**: Logical instructions or code that perform specific tasks or operations.
- **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer that you can touch and interact with (e.g., keyboard, monitor, CPU).
- **Firmware**: Specialized software programmed into hardware, often stored in ROM, used to control and manage hardware functions.

### üß† Hardware Components

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:  
  Volatile memory ‚Äî data is lost when power is off or the system is restarted. Used for temporary data storage during active processes.

- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:  
  Non-volatile memory ‚Äî data remains intact even when the system is powered off. Stores essential programs like firmware and BIOS.

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:  
  The "brain" of the computer/server. It executes instructions and processes data.

- **Other Hardware Examples**:
  - Disk Storage (HDD/SSD)
  - Graphics Card (GPU)
  - Monitor
  - CD-ROM
  - USB Drives
  - Floppy Disk (legacy)

### üíª Operating System (OS)

An operating system is the software platform that manages hardware resources and provides services for application software. It acts as a bridge between user-level applications and the physical hardware.

#### Functions of an Operating System:

1. **Resource Management**: Efficiently allocates and manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, and storage.
2. **Convenience**: Makes computer systems easier to use for developers and end-users.
3. **System Evolution**: Provides a platform for software development, testing, and evolution.
4. **Execution Control**: Manages the execution of programs and processes.

### üóÇÔ∏è OS Architecture: Kernel vs. User Space

- **Kernel Space**:
  - Core part of the OS.
  - Has unrestricted access to hardware.
  - Handles low-level tasks like device management and process scheduling.

- **User Space**:
  - Where user applications run.
  - Has limited access; relies on the kernel for hardware interactions via system calls.

#### System Communication Flow:
